Make sure it's easy to build
  - make instructions for building
  - test on other systems (research labs)
  - make sure instructions include dependencies (sbt)

Create integrity tests.  (Add some example sentences and the expected results.)
  - Change ImplicitRelationExtractorNoLists.filterNoLists and check that tests aren't broken.

Create simple examples
  - for extractor (different versions)
  - for caching
  - custom taggers

export on sbt to make available on maven
  - add instructions on the README about it

Test the highRecallTagger with less memory (java or sbt settings) and see how long it takes to load.

Complete README.  Move the file structure info in there.
